# Welcome to o11y.dev 🔭

**Observability for the Observer**

We are an engineering organization dedicated to the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Observability Engineering**. Our mission is to build tools, integrations, and cognitive architectures that enhance observability workflows, with a strong focus on leveraging [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) in modern, AI-assisted development environments.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

* 🧠 **[opentelemetry-skill](https://github.com/o11y-dev/opentelemetry-skill)** *A Cognitive Architecture for AI-Assisted Observability Engineering.* Exploring how AI agents can autonomously interact with, analyze, and instrument observability systems.

* 🪝 **[opentelemetry-hooks](https://github.com/o11y-dev/opentelemetry-hooks)** *OpenTelemetry integration for AI IDEs.* A Python-based integration for tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot that records AI agent activity and exports detailed telemetry data using the standard OTLP protocol.

## 🛠️ Core Technologies & Focus Areas

* **Observability (o11y)**
* **OpenTelemetry (OTel) & OTLP**
* **AI-Assisted Development (Cursor, Copilot)**
* **Agentic Workflows**

## 📬 Training & Consulting

We offer expert-led workshops, incident response training, and consulting to help teams build resilient systems and cultures. Contact us at **[contact@o11y.dev](mailto:contact@o11y.dev)** to level up your organization in:

* **Observability Engineering & OpenTelemetry**
* **Service Ownership & Reliability**
* **Incident Response & Post-Mortem Facilitation**
* **Agent Assisted Workflows**
* **Root Cause Analysis**
* **KPI Strategies - MTTR / MTTD / DORA**
* **Observability FinOps**
* **Workshops**
