**Observability for the Observer**

We are an engineering organization dedicated to the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Observability Engineering**. 
Our mission is to build tools, integrations, and cognitive architectures that enhance observability workflows, with a strong focus on leveraging [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) in modern, AI-assisted development environments.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

* 🧠 **[opentelemetry-skill](https://github.com/o11y-dev/opentelemetry-skill)** *A Cognitive Architecture for AI-Assisted Observability Engineering.* Exploring how AI agents can autonomously interact with, analyze, and instrument observability systems.

* 🪝 **[opentelemetry-hooks](https://github.com/o11y-dev/opentelemetry-hooks)** *OpenTelemetry integration for AI IDEs.* A Python-based integration for tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot that records AI agent activity and exports detailed telemetry data using the standard OTLP protocol.


## 🤝 Contribute

We are actively exploring the frontiers of AI and Observability and welcome contributions! Feel free to explore our repositories, test out our hooks, open issues, or submit pull requests.
